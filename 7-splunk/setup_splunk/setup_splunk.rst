Setup Splunk
------------

Overview
++++++++

Now that we've configured our Nutanix Objects storage for use by Splunk, we need to deploy Splunk on our Nutanix cluster. The Nutanix platform operates and scales Splunk along with other hosted services, providing a single scalable infrastructure for all deployments. Existing sources can send machine data to the Splunk environment on Nutanix over the network. The following figure shows a high-level view of the Splunk on Nutanix solution.

   .. figure:: images/7.png

#. Click **Save** to create the VM.

#. Find your VM in the VM list, then choose it.

   .. figure:: images/8.png

#. Click **Power On**.

   .. figure:: images/9.png

   .. note::

      Make a note of the **IP Address** of the VM.

      .. figure:: images/10.png

#. Click **Update** in the Prism UI for the VM, then modify the **vDisk**.

   .. figure:: images/26.png

#. Change the **vDisk** size to **100GiB** and click save.

   .. figure:: images/27.png

#. SSH into the Splunk VM using the following credentials (Putty on Windows, Terminal on Mac):

   - **Username** - root
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u

   .. code-block:: bash

     ssh root@10.38.19.50

#. Modify the root partition to take advantage of the extra space.

   .. note::

     Please manually type this step, do not copy it in!

   .. code-block:: bash

    fdisk /dev/sda

    p # Print table
    d # Delete
    2 # Deletes second partition, since Partition 1 is /boot
    n # New Partition
    p # New Primary Partition
    2 # New Primary Partition - /dev/sda2
    Accept defaults for Start Block and End Block
    t # Partition Type
    2 # Partition 2
    8e # Change partition type to "Linux LVM"
    p # Print new partition table
    w # Write New Partition Table

#. Update Kernel Partition Table and Resize Volume

   .. code-block:: bash

    partx -u /dev/sda
    pvresize /dev/sda2
    lvextend -r centos_centos/root /dev/sda2


#. Now let's download the tar files for Splunk and get Splunk installed.

   .. code-block:: bash

     mkdir /opt/splunk
     cd /tmp

#. If your lab cluster is in RTP, use the following command

   .. code-block:: bash

     curl http://10.55.251.38/workshop_staging/Splunk/splunk-8.0.1.tar -o splunk-8.0.1.tar

#. If your lab cluster is in PHX, use the following command

   .. code-block:: bash

     curl http://10.42.194.11/workshop_staging/Splunk/splunk-8.0.1.tar -o splunk-8.0.1.tar

#. Now let's expand what we downloaded, install, and configure Splunk.

   .. code-block:: bash

     tar -xvf splunk-8.0.1.tar
     echo '[user_info]' > /tmp/user-seed.conf
     echo 'USERNAME = admin' >> /tmp/user-seed.conf
     echo 'PASSWORD = nutanix/4u' >> /tmp/user-seed.conf
     export SPLUNK_HOME=/opt/splunk
     export PATH=$SPLUNK_HOME/bin:$PATH
     cp -rp splunk/* /opt/splunk/
     mv /tmp/user-seed.conf $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local
     echo '[clustering]' >> $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
     echo 'mode = master' >> $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
     echo 'replication_factor = 1' >> $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
     echo 'search_factor = 1' >> $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
     echo 'pass4SymmKey = nutanix/4u' >> $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
     echo 'cluster_label = cluster1' >> $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
     splunk start --answer-yes --no-prompt --accept-license

   .. figure:: images/11.png

#. At this point Splunk should be installed and running, but we need to make a small firewall change in order to connect to it.

   .. code-block:: bash

     firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8000/tcp
     firewall-cmd --reload

#. Open your web browser and go to **http://<SPLUNK_IP>:8000**.

#. The username and password should be as you set them above:

   - **Username** - admin
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u

   .. figure:: images/12.png

#. There's not a lot going on right now, but before we give Splunk something to do, we need to connect it to Nutanix Objects.

Configure SmartStore
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Gather the required information:

   - MYOBJECTSACCESSKEY: You should have this from the *IAM Key* section above
   - MYOBJECTSSECRETKEY: You should have this from the *IAM Key* section above
   - MYAWESOMEBUCKETHERE: You should have this from the *Create Bucket Using IAM User* section above
   - OBJECTSCLIENTIP: You can get this from **â˜° Menu > Services > Objects**

   .. figure:: images/17.png

#. SSH into the Splunk VM (Putty on Windows, Terminal on Mac)

   - **Username** - root
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u

   .. code-block:: bash

     ssh root@10.38.19.50

#. Use **vi** or **nano** to edit the following file:

   .. code-block:: bash

     vi /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/indexes.conf
     OR
     nano /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/indexes.conf

   .. note::

     If you're using **vi**, ensure to type "**i**" to enter **INSERT** mode.

#. The file contents should look like the below. Ensure to replace any **ALL CAPS** sections with your relevant details.

   .. code-block:: bash

     [default]
     remotePath = volume:remote_store/$_index_name

     [volume:remote_store]
     storageType = remote
     path = s3://MYAWESOMEBUCKETHERE/
     remote.s3.access_key = MYOBJECTSACCESSKEY
     remote.s3.secret_key = MYOBJECTSSECRETKEY
     remote.s3.endpoint = https://OBJECTSCLIENTIP
     remote.s3.auth_region = us-east-1

#. Save the file (Nano: CTRL+O, CTRL+X, or VI: ESC, :wq ENTER ).

   .. note::

     We'll restart Splunk in the next section after installing the Log Generator App.


Install Log Generator App
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now let's install the log generator app, so we can give Splunk something to consume.

#. SSH into the Splunk VM (Putty on Windows, Terminal on Mac)

   - **Username** - root
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u

   .. code-block:: bash

     ssh root@10.38.19.50

#. Copy down the GoGen files, modified for Nutanix/Splunk.

   .. code-block:: bash

     cd /tmp
     curl -LJO http://10.42.194.11/workshop_staging/Splunk/TA-Nutanix.zip -o TA-Nutanix.zip
     yum install unzip -y
     unzip TA-Nutanix.zip
     cp -r gogen-master/splunk_app_gogen /opt/splunk/etc/apps/

#. Restart **Splunk** so the new application shows up.

   .. code-block:: bash

     /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart

#. Log back into the Splunk web interface, you'll see that **GoGen** is now showing up in the application list.

   .. figure:: images/14.png

#. Click on **Settings > Data Inputs**.

   .. figure:: images/15.png

#. Click on **GoGen**.

#. Click on the stanza name: **retail_transaction**.

#. Fill in the fields to look like the below image, click save:

   .. figure:: images/23.png

#. Enable **retail_transaction**.

   .. figure:: images/24.png

#. Restart **Splunk** one more time.

   .. code-block:: bash

     /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart


Data in Objects
+++++++++++++++

After a little bit of time, you should be able to head over to Objects in PC and see that your bucket is being populated with data.

.. note::

   If after 5 minutes, you're not seeing this, you can try running the following script from the Splunk server:

   .. code-block:: bash

     splunk _internal call /data/indexes/main/roll-hot-buckets -auth admin:nutanix/4u

#. You can see in the performance information for my bucket that there have been some Puts and Gets, although the timeline is short for the purposes of this demo, these patterns would continue.

   .. figure:: images/25.png

Takeaways
+++++++++

- SmartStore is simple to configure with Nutanix Objects
